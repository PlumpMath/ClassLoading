	 * equal to code_length, the length of the code array. The value of start_pc must be less than the value of end_pc.

	 * counter is within the interval [start_pc, end_pc).4

	 * exceptions that this exception handler is designated to catch. This class must be the class Throwable or one
	 * of its subclasses. The exception handler will be called only if the thrown exception is an instance of the
	 * given class or one of its subclasses.
	 * If the value of the catch_type item is zero, this exception handler is called for all exceptions. This is used
